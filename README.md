nopasswd-scan
=============

Find files that don't need a password to be executed by sudo.

Usually, this can be done by using ```sudo -l```, if the security policy (```listpw```) isn't set to ask a password, if this isn't your case, this tool will help you.


Usage
-----

```
$ ./nopasswd-scan [FILE]
```

**[FILE]** is a file that contains the file list to be checked.
